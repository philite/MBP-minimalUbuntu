# Preparing Stage

## Guides

I am using ElementaryOS on a Mac guide to guide me on this process, since ElementaryOS is also based on Ubuntu distros

*Also Gentoo's config for MBP 13" 2015 for drivers

## MacOS prep

### Etcher USB Creator 
  
  I use Etcher to create a bootable linux thumbdrive.
  
### Ubuntu Linux ISO (Ubuntu-ISO variant)
  
  I choose Ubuntu_mini to install only package I needed to use the OS.
  
### MBP Partitioning

  I want 65% Linux and 35% MacOS

  Required for booting
